# Landmarks

This is an application that can run on iOS and iPadOS and displays information about different mountains, lakes, and rivers in the US. The application makes use of SwiftUI to create sophisticated User Interface controls that work seamlessly on many Apple devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and various Apple computers (MacOS Port coming soon).

## About

This application for displaying different landmarks makes use of the Apple Maps API to locate the landmark and gives a description of it. The app can display these locations in a list view and as a featured page where they can be categorised into lakes, Mountains, and rivers. 

In addition to this, the app also features a user profile that can be customised to the user's liking. The user can customise their username, enable notifications, change their seasonal photo, and even set their goal date to visit certain landmarks. The user profile also features an achievements section to show the different achievements the user has in the form of badges. There is also a recent hikes section in the profile which can show the activity of the user on certain landmarks.
